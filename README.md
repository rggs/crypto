# 1. Asynchronous 1Inch Prices
My goal with this code was to gain experience with web3 and APIs, in particular a DEX api. The script accesses the 1Inch API and checks to see if any arbitrage
 opportunities exist by choosing different protocol paths through 1Inch. Unsurprisingly, no such opportunities exist, at least in the simple way done in the 
 script.

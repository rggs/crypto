# crypto
A repository containing code for projects relating to cryptocurrencies.

# 1. Asynchronous 1Inch Prices
 My goal with this code was to gain experience with web3 and APIs, in particular a DEX api. The script accesses the 1Inch API and checks to see if any arbitrage
 opportunities exist by choosing different protocol paths through 1Inch. Unsurprisingly, no such opportunities exist, at least in the simple way done in the 
 script.  


# 2. ABIs & Contract Interactions
 For this project, I wanted to get the Uniswap V2 pair contracts using direct smart contract interaction through etherscan's API. Although not fast, 
 it does provide a lot of valuable insight into how smart contracts work and how to utilize them.
